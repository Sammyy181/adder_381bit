# adder_381bit

This Project implements a 381 Bit adder on Verilog. The designed circuit has been implemented and tested successfully on a Nexys4 DDR FPGA. The constraints.xdc file can be used for this FPGA using Xilinx.

The Python file can be used to read the Tx output coming from the FPGA through UART.
